- cloud native practices and components :

- Cloud Migration vs. Cloud Native

            - DevOps     : Practices for removing barriers between development and operations
            - Continuous delivery, continuous upgrades, and automated scalability: Practices vital to DevOps success
            - Containers, including Docker: A method for bundling software and its dependencies into one package
            - Kubernetes: A tool for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications
            - Orchestration: Automated configuration, coordination, and management of cloud systems, resources, and software
            - Microservices: Architecture for building applications as a collection of services or protocols

- The design principles of Cloud Native applications are:
            - Design for 
                   - Performance (responsiveness, concurrency, efficiency)
                   - Automation (automation of infrastructure and development tasks)
                   - Resiliency (fault-tolerance, self-healing)
                   - Elasticity (automatic scaling)
                   - Delivery (minimise cycle time, automate deployments)
                   - Diagnosability (cluster-wide logs, traces, and metrics)

- Application Requirements on Infrastructure for cloud native 
            - Application Runtime and Isolation
            - Resource Allocation and Scheduling
            - Environment Isolation
            - Service Discovery
            - State Management
            - Monitoring and Logging
            - Metrics Aggregation
            - Debugging and Tracing
